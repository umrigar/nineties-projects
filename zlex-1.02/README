zlex is a scanner generator which is largely upward-compatible with lex and
flex.  

INSTALLATION:

The file INSTALL contains generic installation instructions.  Refer to that
file if the following instructions are insufficient.

If are lucky, all you will need to install the package is the following
sequence of commands.

cd to the directory this file is in.

./configure  #Figure out what features relevant to zyacc your system has.
	     #Generate customized Makefiles and a config.h file.

make         #compile and link.  Executables reside within this directory.

make check   #Do some testing (but see below for further tests).

make install #Install zyacc executable and zyacc skeleton file in
	     #"standard" places.

The "standard" places where the above sequence will install (unless your
environment specifically requests something different from configure), is
/usr/local/bin for the zyacc executable and /usr/local/share/zyacc for the
zyacc skeleton file, usr/local/info for the info documentation,
/usr/local/share/doc for the HTML documentation.  The postscript
documentation is not installed by default, but can be printed out or copied
over to another directory.

If the above "standard" places is not acceptable, then if you would just
like to install at a different prefix, then specify the --prefix option when
you run configure.  For example, if you would like to install in your home
directory, configure as follows:

./configure --prefix="$HOME"

If you are not installing in the standard places (for example, you may
not have root access, or your site may use different conventions from
those assumed here), then one alternative is to compile zyacc specifying
some make variable definitions on the make command line.  Assume I'd
like the executable to go in /usr/users/zdu/bin and the skeleton to go
in /usr/users/zdu/etc, I'd use the following command line:

make bindir=/usr/users/zdu/bin datadir=/usr/users/zdu/etc

Use the same definitions for make install

make install bindir=/usr/users/zdu/bin datadir=/usr/users/zdu/etc

or you can simply copy the files over, and set appropriate permissions.
(the info file goes into Make variable $(infodir) and the HTML into 
$(docdir)).

ADDITIONAL TESTS:

If you'd like, you can run additional tests before making install.  Go to
the src/tests directory and type make.  This will do additional testing ---
these tests could take a very long time to run (hours) depending on the
capabilities of your system.
