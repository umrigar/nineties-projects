This directory contains regression tests for zlex.  They are not run
during the usual installation, as they take a while.  They are useful
during zlex maintenance and development.

To run all the tests, simply type `make' in this directory.

To run a subset of the tests, which have a chance of completing in a
reasonable time, do `make QUICK' in this directory.
