This directory contains performance tests for zlex.  They are not run
during the usual installation, as they take a while.  They are useful
during zlex maintenance and development.

To run the performance tests, simply type `make' in this directory.

<CPU>.log contains a log for CPU.

The shell-script doperf does almost everything.  It uses a few non-portable
commands: 

uname -a: To find out which system its running on.

/bin/time (or other path): We assume that after stripping away all chars,
the first field is the user-time and the 2nd field is the system time.  If 
that is not the case, the output needs to be massaged into that form.

size: We assume that the first 3 fields of the second line of the output
give the sizes of text, data and bss.
