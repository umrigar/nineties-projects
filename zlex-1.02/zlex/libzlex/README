This directory contains the source files for the zlex library.

The header for the library is divided into three portions:

libzlex.h:	Public interface.
libzlexs.h:	Interface required by scanner skeleton.
libzlex0.h:	Private routines.

The actual code files include an automatically generated header libzlexp.h
which is simply the catenation of the above three header files.
