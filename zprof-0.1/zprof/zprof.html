<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>zprof</STRONG> is a preprocessor which transforms a ANSI-C  program
       to  enable  basic  block  profiling.  When the transformed
       program is compiled and executed, it records the number of
       times each of its basic blocks is executed.



       Each  source  file  <EM>file</EM><STRONG>.c</STRONG> is transformed to <EM>file</EM><STRONG>_BB.c</STRONG> (to
       change the output name, see  the  <STRONG>--prefix</STRONG>  option).   The
       transformed  program  needs  to  be  linked with the <STRONG>zprof</STRONG>
       library <STRONG>libzprof.a</STRONG>.  When the transformed program is  exe-
       cuted, it appends the execution counts of its basic blocks
       to the file <STRONG>zprof.out</STRONG>.  The <STRONG>zcounts</STRONG> script uses the gener-
       ated <STRONG>zprof.out</STRONG> file to produce an annotated version of the
       original files (with names of  the  form  <EM>file</EM><STRONG>.c.bb</STRONG>)  with
       each line preceeded by its execution count.  The <STRONG>zprof.out</STRONG>
       file can also be analyzed using  standard  utilities  (see
       the <STRONG>EXAMPLES</STRONG> section).


       If  no  source  files are specified, <STRONG>zprof</STRONG> simply prints a
       summary of its options and exits.



</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>Zprof</STRONG> supports both traditional single-letter options  and
       mnemonic  long  option names.  Long option names are indi-
       cated using --  instead  of  -.   Abbreviations  for  long
       option names are allowed as long as they are unique.  When
       a long option like <STRONG>--prefix</STRONG> takes an argument, connect the
       option name and the argument with = or put the argument in
       the next word.  Similarly, when a  short  option  like  <STRONG>-p</STRONG>
       takes  an  argument,  put  the  argument value immediately
       after the option in the same word, or put the argument  in
       the  next  word.  Boolean argument values may be specified
       as <STRONG>0</STRONG> or <STRONG>1</STRONG>, <STRONG>yes</STRONG> or <STRONG>no</STRONG>, <STRONG>on</STRONG> or <STRONG>off</STRONG>.


       <STRONG>--cond</STRONG>
       <STRONG>-c</STRONG>     Profile  subexpressions  of  all   ?:   conditional
              expressions (default: <STRONG>off</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>--help</STRONG>
       <STRONG>-h</STRONG>     Print summary of options and exit.

       <STRONG>--prefix</STRONG>=<EM>PREFIX</EM>
       <STRONG>-p</STRONG><EM>PREFIX</EM>

              Use  <EM>PREFIX</EM>  as  prefix  of  all generated names in
              instrumented file and for forming the name  of  the
              output files (default: <STRONG>_BB</STRONG>).


       <STRONG>--preprocess</STRONG>
       <STRONG>-P</STRONG>     Run  the  preprocessor  (given by environmental var
              <STRONG>CPP</STRONG>)  on  the  input  file  before  <STRONG>zprof</STRONG>  sees  it
              (default: <STRONG>on</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>--silent</STRONG>
       <STRONG>-s</STRONG>     Do not generate error messages (default: <STRONG>off</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>--version</STRONG>
       <STRONG>-v</STRONG>     Print version information and exit.

       <STRONG>--typedef</STRONG>=<EM>ID</EM>
       <STRONG>-t</STRONG><EM>ID</EM>   Declare identifier <EM>ID</EM> to be a typedef in the global
              scope.



</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2><PRE>
       If preprocessing is not turned off using  <STRONG>--preprocess</STRONG>=<STRONG>no</STRONG>,
       then  the  command used to run the C-preprocessor is taken
       from the  environmental  variable  <STRONG>CPP</STRONG>.   If  <STRONG>CPP</STRONG>  is  not
       defined,  then the name of a C compiler is sought in envi-
       ronmental variable <STRONG>CC</STRONG>, and each source file <EM>file</EM><STRONG>.c</STRONG> is pre-
       processed using the command:

                <STRONG>$CC</STRONG> -E <EM>file</EM><STRONG>.c</STRONG>

       If  <STRONG>CC</STRONG> is also not defined, then the C-preprocessor is run
       using

                cc -E <EM>file</EM><STRONG>.c</STRONG>




</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       Consider  the  simple  prime  number  program  from   file
       <STRONG>primes.c</STRONG> shown below:

           static int
           prime(int n)
           {
             int i;
             for (i= 2; i &lt; n; i++) {
               if (n % i == 0) {
                 return 0;
               }
             }
             return 1;
           }

           int
           main()
           {
             const int n= 1000;
             int i;
             for (i= 2; i &lt;= n; i++) {
               if (prime(i)) {
                 printf("%d0, i);
               }
             }
             return 0;
           }

       This can be profiled as follows:
           $ zprof primes.c
           $ cc primes_BB.c -lzprof -o primes_bb
           $ rm -f zprof.out
           $ ./primes_bb &gt;/dev/null
           $ zcounts

       The  first line transforms <STRONG>primes.c</STRONG> into <STRONG>primes_BB.c</STRONG> which
       has additional code for accumulating profile counts.   The
       second  line  compiles  the transformed file and links the
       object file with the <STRONG>zprof</STRONG> library to  get  an  executable
       <STRONG>primes_bb</STRONG>.   The  third  line  ensures  that  there  is no
       <STRONG>zprof.out</STRONG> file present in the current  directory,  as  the
       execution  counts  from  the next step are appended to it.
       The fourth line runs <STRONG>primes_bb</STRONG>, producing a <STRONG>zprof.out</STRONG> file
       containing  the execution statistics.  The final line uses
       the statistics to produce an annotated version <STRONG>primes.c.bb</STRONG>
       shown below:

                    static int
                    prime(int n)
                    {
                      int i;
           999        for (i= 2; i &lt; n; i++) {
           78022        if (n % i == 0) {
           831            return 0;
                        }
                      }
           168        return 1;
                    }

                    int
                    main()
                    {
                      const int n= 1000;
                      int i;
           1          for (i= 2; i &lt;= n; i++) {
           999          if (prime(i)) {
           168            printf("%d0, i);
                        }
                      }
           1          return 0;
                    }


       In  order  to correctly parse C, it is necessary to recog-
       nize <STRONG>typedef</STRONG>s.  Since <STRONG>typedef</STRONG>s are often defined in header
       files,  it is necessary to parse all included header files
       --- this is typically done by running  the  C-preprocessor
       first.   Unfortunately,  on  some  systems like Linux, the
       system header files use non-ANSI extensions, which  causes
       problems for <STRONG>zprof</STRONG> which expects ANSI-C.  It is still pos-
       sible to use <STRONG>zprof</STRONG> on such systems by using the  C-prepro-
       cessor  to  remove  the non-ANSI extensions.  For example,
       the following works  for  profiling  some  programs  under
       Linux.

           $ CPP="gcc -E -D'__attribute(n)__=' -D__const=const" \
             <STRONG>zprof</STRONG> ...

       The  options  <STRONG>--preprocess=0</STRONG>,  <STRONG>--silent</STRONG>  and <STRONG>--typedef</STRONG> may
       also be useful in such situations  where  a  header  which
       cannot otherwise be parsed defines only a few <STRONG>typedef</STRONG>s.




</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       The  format  of  the  generated <STRONG>zprof.out</STRONG> file consists of
       lines of the form:

                <EM>filename</EM>:<EM>linenum</EM>: <EM>count</EM>

       specifying that line number <EM>linenum</EM> in file  <EM>filename</EM>  was
       executed  <EM>count</EM> times.  If there are multiple basic blocks
       associated with a particular source  line,  then  multiple
       lines  will be produced for the same <EM>filename</EM> and <EM>linenum</EM>.


       The above format is amenable to easy processing by several
       tools:


       +      The  file  can easily be sorted in descending order
              of counts:

                  sort -t: -nr -2 zprof.out


       +      Emacs compilation-mode can be used to interactively
              browse this file.  <STRONG>M-x</STRONG> <STRONG>compile</STRONG> can be used to start
              compilation and  the  compilation  command  can  be
              specified  simply  as  <STRONG>cat</STRONG> <STRONG>zprof.out</STRONG>.  Then the <STRONG>M-`</STRONG>
              command can be used repeatedly to position the cur-
              sor  at  each  source line with its execution count
              shown in the compilation buffer.
