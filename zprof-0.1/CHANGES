version 0.1:

    + Added zprofDebug target to Makefile to make it easy to generate
      demos for zydebug.

    + Removed multiple-files on command-line.  Added a --output option 
      to allow the user to name the output C file.

    + 'libz' library changed so that only necessary modules are
      distributed.

    + New 'hashtab' module added to 'libz'; 'textid' module 
      changed to use it.

    + Couple of bug fixes to 'libz'.  Both bugs caused by
      side-effects in function calls being dependent on the order
      of evaluation of the arguments.  Unfortunately, *there*
      *may* *be* *others*.

    + 'zprof' code changed to use new 'hashtab' module.  Otherwise,
      no change to 'zprof' code.

    + This file created and added to distribution.
