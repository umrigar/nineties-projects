<P>The recursive descent parser displays its output in three windows:

<DL>

<LI><DT><A NAME="tree"><B>Parse Tree Window</B></A><DD>

The top window displays the parse tree as it is being constructed.  Nodes
are shown in green while their subtrees are still being built (tracing the
green nodes from the bottom to the top gives the contents of the stack).
When all the subtrees of a node have been built, the color of the node is
changed to red.  As the parser is stepped, the window will always display
the current node of interest which is highlighted in yellow.

<LI><DT><A NAME="program"><B>Program Window</B></A><DD>

This shows the recursive descent parsing program in java.  At each step, the
parser highlights the line it is currently executing.

<LI><DT><A NAME="trace"><B>Trace Window</B></A><DD>

This window shows the trace history in the format used in classical compiler
texts.  Each trace line consists of the stack (in green) followed by the
input (in black) which is yet to be processed.  The current lookahead token
is always the first token in the unexpended input.  The stack shows the
control stack --- i.e., it contains the parsing functions which have been
called but have not yet returned.  They correspond to the green nodes in the
parse tree.

</DL>

<P> Each window displays a brief description of itself for a short period
after the mouse pointer enters it.
