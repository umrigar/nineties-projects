<H2>Grammars</H2>

<P> Any natural language like English or a programming language like Pascal
has a vocabulary of words.  For example, the vocabulary for Pascal contains
words like <CODE>for</CODE>, <CODE>x</CODE>, <CODE>;</CODE>, <CODE>:=</CODE>
or <CODE>1</CODE>. A sentence of the language consists of some sequence of
words taken from this vocabulary. For example, with the above vocabulary, we
can compose the legal Pascal statement:

<PRE>
	x:= 1
</PRE>

But not all possible sequences over a given vocabulary are legal, as the
sequences need to meet certain syntactic and semantic restrictions. For
example, with the Pascal vocabulary, we can construct the sequence of words

<PRE>
	x:= for 1
</PRE>
which is syntactically illegal.

<P> A context free grammar provides a method for specifying which of the
sentences are syntactically legal and which are syntactically illegal.  A
context free grammar can be specified by a sequence of rules like the
following (the rules are numbered for reference):

<PRE>
1)	program:	stmts '.'
2)	stmts:		stmt ';' stmts
3)	stmts:		stmt
4)	stmt:		ID ':=' expr
5)	expr:		NUM
6)	expr:		expr '+' NUM
</PRE>

Each rule consists of a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS)
separated by a colon.  The LHS contains a single symbol, whereas the RHS can
consist of a (possibly empty) sequence of grammar symbols separated by
spaces.  Each rule can be viewed as a <EM>rewrite rule</EM>, specifying that
whenever we have an occurrence of a LHS symbol, it can be rewritten to the
RHS.  For example, we can rewrite the LHS symbol <CODE>program</CODE> as
follows:

<PRE>
	program ==>	stmts .			<R>by rule 1</R>
                ==>	stmt .			<R>by rule 3</R>
		==>	ID := expr .		<R>by rule 4</R>
		==>	ID := NUM .		<R>by rule 5</R>
</PRE>

Note that the above rewrite sequence or <EM>derivation</EM> terminates as we
cannot rewrite <CODE>ID</CODE>, <CODE>:=</CODE>, <CODE>NUM</CODE> or
<CODE>.</CODE> any further because they do not appear on the LHS of any
rule.  Symbols like these terminate the derivation and are referred to as
<EM>terminal symbols</EM>.  The other grammar symbols which occur on the LHS
of grammar rules are referred to as <EM>nonterminal symbols</EM>.  The
terminal symbols correspond to words in the vocabulary.  The nonterminal
symbols correspond to legal phrases or sentences formed using words from the
vocabulary.

<P> The terminal symbols are of two types: terminals which stand for a
single word in the vocabulary and terminals which stand for a class of
multiple vocabulary words.  In the grammar, we denote terminals of the 
former type by enclosing the vocabulary word within quotes  (for example, 
<CODE>':='</CODE> denotes the single vocabulary word <CODE>:=</CODE>), and
denote symbols of the latter type with a name which uses only upper-case
letters (for example, <CODE>ID</CODE> denotes the class of all vocabulary
words which are identifiers).

<P> Not all the phrases of a language are sentences in the language; for
example, a Pascal statement by itself (a phrase) is not a legal Pascal
program (a sentence).  To ensure that a grammar describes only complete
sentences, we distinguish one nonterminal called the <EM>start
nonterminal</EM> from all others, and restrict all derivations to start from
this distinguished start symbol.

<P> We can now define a <A NAME="sentential-form"><EM>sentential
form</EM></A> of a grammar <VAR>G</VAR> to be any sequence of grammar
symbols (terminals or nonterminals) derived in 0 or more steps from the
start symbol of <VAR>G</VAR>.  A <EM>sentence</EM> is a sentential-form
which contains only terminal symbols.  The language defined by grammar
<VAR>G</VAR> is the set of all sentences which can be derived from the start
symbol of <VAR>G</VAR>.


<P> To review, a context-free grammar <VAR>G</VAR> consists of a 4-tuple
&lt;<VAR>N</VAR>, <VAR>T</VAR>, <VAR>R</VAR>, <VAR>S</VAR>&gt;, where
<VAR>N</VAR> is a set of nonterminal symbols, <VAR>T</VAR> is a set of
terminal symbols (disjoint from <VAR>N</VAR>), <VAR>R</VAR> is a set of
rules, and <VAR>S</VAR> is a distinguished start nonterminal belonging to
<VAR>N</VAR>.  Each rule in <VAR>R</VAR> is of the form <VAR>A</VAR>:
<VAR>X</VAR>, where <VAR>A</VAR> is a nonterminal in <VAR>N</VAR> and
<VAR>X</VAR> is a possibly empty sequence of terminal and nonterminal
symbols.


<P> Note that a context-free grammar enforces only syntactic restrictions.
It does not enforce any semantic restrictions on the sentences to ensure
that they make sense.  For example, a typical English grammar would allow
the sentence 

<BLOCKQUOTE>

This page is swimming in the river

</BLOCKQUOTE> 

as grammatically correct, even though it does not make any sense.

<H2>Parse Trees</H2>

Consider a derivation of the sentence
<PRE>
	a:= 1 + 2 .
</PRE>
in the above grammar (repeated here for reference):
<PRE>
1)	program:	stmts .
2)	stmts:		stmt ; stmts
3)	stmts:		stmt
4)	stmt:		ID := expr
5)	expr:		NUM
6)	expr:		expr + NUM
</PRE>
The derivation proceed as follows:
<PRE>
	program ==>	stmts .			<R>by rule 1</R>
                ==>	stmt .			<R>by rule 3</R>
		==>	ID := expr .		<R>by rule 4</R>
		==>	ID := expr + NUM .	<R>by rule 6</R>
		==>	ID := NUM + NUM         <R>by rule 5</R>
</PRE>
This derivation imposes a structure on the sentence which is shown
by the following <EM>parse tree</EM>:
<CENTER>

     ALT="parse tree figure"  >

</CENTER>
The root of the parse tree corresponds to the start symbol.  For each step
in the derivation, when a LHS grammar nonterminal is replaced with the RHS of
some grammar rule for that LHS, the RHS symbols are added as children to the
node (shown in red) corresponding to the LHS symbol in the parse tree.
After the derivation is complete, the leaves of the parse tree (shown in
cyan) correspond to the terminal symbols in the sentence.

<H2>Language Analysis</H2>

We can analyze the sentences of a language by extracting the
grammatical structure of the sentence.  This is done by building an explicit
or implicit parse tree for the sentence.  The language analysis component of
a system is usually organized as two distinct modules:

<DL>

<DT><B>Scanner</B><DD>

The scanner accepts a stream of characters and breaks it up into words or
<EM>tokens</EM>.  A token gives the <EM>lexeme</EM> or actual text of the
word  as well as identifying what kind of word it is.  The kind is usually
encoded as a small integer.  Hence the declaration for a token would look
something like the following C <CODE>typedef</CODE>
<PRE>
	typedef struct {
	  char *lexeme;		/* actual characters of token */
	  int kind;		/* class of token */
	} Token;

</PRE>


<DT><B>Parser</B><DD>

The parser accepts a stream of tokens from the scanner and extracts the
grammatical structure of the sentence and builds (conceptually at least) a
parse tree for the sentence.
</DL>

<P> The parser can be organized so as to attempt to build a derivation of
the sentence from the start symbol of the grammar.  This kind of parser is
referred to as a <EM>top-down parser</EM>, because in terms of the parse
tree, it is built from the top to the bottom.  Alternately, it can be
organized so as to attempt to trace out a derivation in reverse, going from
the sentence to the start symbol.  This kind of parser is
referred to as a <EM>bottom-up parser</EM>, because in terms of the parse
tree, it is built from the bottom to the top.  

<P> A top-down parser needs to make two kinds of decisions at each step:

<OL>

<LI> It needs to choose a nonterminal in the frontier of the current
parse tree to expand next.

<LI> In general, a nonterminal may have several rules associated with
it.  Hence the parser needs to decide which rule to use to expand the
nonterminal it chose in (1).

</OL>
A bottom-up parser needs to make similar decisions.

<P> A common organization used in batch compilers is for the parser to call
the scanner whenever it is needs another token.  Usually, the parser needs
to look at one or more tokens to make its parsing decisions: these tokens
which the parser is examining but not yet consumed are called <EM>lookahead
tokens</EM>.  Typically, the parser needs to use a single lookahead token.
