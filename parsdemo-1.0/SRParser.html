<P> This page contains a java applet which demonstrates the operation of a
recursive-descent parser for a <A HREF="simpcomp_2.html"
TARGET="left">simple language</A> consisting of assignment statements and
arithmetic expressions.  An <A HREF="srintro.html">introduction</A> to
shift-reduce parsing is also available.


<H2>Applet Layout</H2>

<P> The layout of the applet is as shown below.  You can click on any of the
yellow areas to get a fuller description in the frame to the left.

<H2>Running the Applet</H2>

<P> Please be patient: depending on the speed of your network connection,
the applet may take a few minutes to load.  Here it is...

<HR>
<APPLET CODE="zdu.parsdemo.ParsDemo.class"
   NAME="SRParser" WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=300 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10> 
Your browser does not appear to be java-enabled.
</APPLET>
<HR>

If you find the size of the applet embedded above inconvenient, then you
can

<APPLET CODE="zdu.parsdemo.FullFrame.class" 
  WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">
<PARAM NAME="APPLET_ALG" VALUE="SR">
start <EM>(but your browser doesn't appear to be java-enabled)</EM> 
<CODE>:-(</CODE>
</APPLET>

another copy of the applet in a separate window which you may resize to your
convenience (if permitted to do so by the security model used by your
browser).

<P> Any misbehavior of the applet may be due to known <A HREF="compat.html">
incompatiblities</A>.

<P>

If you have clicked the <CODE>update</CODE> button in the applet above and
if your platform is suitable, then the details (LR(0) items, etc) of the
current state are shown in the browser frame to the left of this frame.  You
can click on the links in that frame to look at the details of the parser
construction.

<P>

The traditional <EM>goto</EM> step of traditional compiler texts, is broken
up into two substeps by the applet.  In the first substep, the subtree for
the reduction is constructed off the stack.  In the second substep, the
state revealed on top of the stack is used to lookup the <CODE>goto</CODE>
table and put the constructed subtree onto the stack.

<P>

A word about parser start-up and termination.  The parse-tree shown in the
applet's top window does not include the effects of the augmenting production:
<PRE>
	$S: program &lt;EOF&gt; 
</PRE> 
Hence, when the parser starts up, the first step which puts <CODE>$S</CODE>
onto the parse stack has no effect on the parse-tree.  Similarly, an attempt
to reduce by the augmenting production effectively terminates the parse.
