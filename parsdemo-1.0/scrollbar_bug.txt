Scrollbars compiled under 1.02 do not appear to work under a Java
1.1.1 runtime.  The clearest example of this is to point a 1.1
browser like HotJava to the ImageScroller example in Sun's Java
tutorial:

http://java.sun.com:80/docs/books/tutorial/ui/components/scrollbar.html

The displayed image has a large portion of it (bottom right) cut
off.  If you use a browser with a 1.02 runtime like Netscape 3.0,
the full image is seen.

I've had similar results using appletviewers 1.1.1 and 1.02.  The
example given for the Scrollbar class in the Chan & Lee book had
similar problems (the problems were exacerbated somewhat, as IMHO
the example is buggy even for 1.02).

Finally, here is a quick test included:

-------------------------- CUT HERE INTO T.java ---------------
import java.awt.*;

class T extends Frame {

  T() {
    sb= new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.VERTICAL, 0, 10, 0, 100);
    add("West", sb);
  }

  public boolean handleEvent(Event evt) {
    if (evt.target == sb) {
      System.out.println(sb.getMinimum() + "/" + sb.getMaximum() 
			 + ": " + sb.getValue());
    }
    return false;
  }

  private Scrollbar sb;

  public static void main(String args[]) {
    T t= new T();
    t.resize(200, 200);
    t.show();
    
  }
}
--------------------------- END CUT -----------------------------

As the scrollbar is scrolled, the value increases only up to 90
under 1.1.1, as opposed to 100 (the getMaximum() value) under
1.02.

I have had the same results with jdk1.1.1 running under Linux,
Solaris and Windows NT.

I can modify my program to work under a 1.1.1 runtime, but I 
can't make the same program work under both a 1.02 runtime and
a 1.1.1 runtime.

Unless I'm missing something, this appears to be a serious
undocumented incompatibilty which implies that 1.02 compiled
programs which use scrollbars will not work correctly under a 1.1
runtime.
