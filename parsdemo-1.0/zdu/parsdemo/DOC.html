<P> This note documents the overall design of the <CODE>ParsDemo</CODE>
program.  It assumes that the reader is familiar with the operation of the
program.

<P> Most of the classes which constitute the program are individually
trivial.  Some of them have <CODE>javadoc</CODE> style documentation, but I
did not use that style of documentation much as I found it too bureaucratic
and more suited for documenting the external interfaces of packages.  This
note documents how all the classes fit together.

<P> Initially, an attempt was made to separate the GUI aspects of the
program from the parsing aspects of the program.  Though this
attempt was not entirely successful, the classes can be separated into 4
broad categories:

<DL>

<DT><B>Container classes</B></DD> These may be useful outside this package.
However, they would need more work to be made usable in a general package.

<DT><B>Domain classes</B><DD> Classes having knowledge of the domain
being visualized in this program.  Classes in this category implement
grammars, scanners and parsers.

<DT><B>GUI classes</B><DD> Classes in this category implement several custom
canvases for displaying the state of the parse.

<DT><B>Interface classes</B><DD> Used to exchange information between the
domain classes and the top-level classes.

<DT><B>Top-level classes</B><DD> They set up the GUI, start the parsers, and
take care of synchronizing the parser operation with the GUI display.

</DL>

<H2> Utility Classes </H2>

<P>These are general container classes which may be useful outside this
package.  

<P><A HREF="Tree.java">Tree</A> supports general n-ary trees.  Each tree
node can hold an arbitrary information <CODE>Object</CODE>. The
implementation of a tree-node uses two object references: a
<CODE>kids</CODE> reference referencing the leftmost kid of a node and a
<CODE>sibs</CODE> reference referencing the next sibling of the node.  The
<CODE>sibs</CODE> reference chain is linked through the parent to form a
circular list (with a flag used to establish when the reference goes up from
sibling to parent).  These references make arbitrary tree navigation
possible, though care has to be taken when a subtree is added/removed from a
node.  In particular, care should be taken that <STRONG>a subtree is never
simultaneously linked into more than one tree</STRONG>, else strange things
will happen.  The class can probably use some debugging code to check for
such anomalous situations. 

<P> Currently, other classes are derived from <CODE>Tree</CODE>.  It is
probably better to merely treat <CODE>Tree</CODE> as a general hierarchical
<CODE>Object</CODE> container.

<P><A HREF="Table2.java">Table2</A> is an abstract class supporting
2-dimensional tables.  A row/column index can be any arbitrary
<CODE>Object</CODE>, as can the contents of each cell.  The table is
accessed and updated using <CODE>get()</CODE> and <CODE>put()</CODE> methods
respectively.  Since the table is expected to be sparse, the <A
HREF="SparseTable2.java">SparseTable2</A> implementation uses a hashtable
indexed by a auxiliary <A HREF="RowCol.java">RowCol</A> class.  A blank
entry is represented using a <CODE>null</CODE> <CODE>Object</CODE>.

<H2> Domain Classes </H2>

<P> A grammar is represented using the abstract <A
HREF="Grammar.java">Grammar</A> class.  This class must be subclassed for a
concrete grammar.  Grammar symbols (<A HREF="GramSym.java">GramSym</A>) and
rules are maintained by the <A HREF="Terminal.java">Terminal</A>, <A
HREF="NonTerm.java">NonTerm</A> and <A HREF="Rule.java">Rule</A> classes.
Conceptually, these classes are inner classes (in the sense of Java 1.1) of
the <CODE>Grammar</CODE> class.  The <CODE>Grammar</CODE> class exports
special grammar symbols like <CODE>EOF</CODE> which every grammar should
have.  It also has special protected interfaces for its subclasses to create
the grammar symbols and rules.

<P> Rule RHS's are stored within an array within the <CODE>Grammar</CODE>
class.  Hence an <EM>item</EM> (in the LR-item sense) is merely an index
into this array.

<P> The example program contains two concrete grammars which are
instantiations of the <A HREF="Grammar.java">Grammar</A> class: <A
HREF="SimpCompSRGram.java">SimpCompSRGram</A> and <A
HREF="SimpCompLL1Gram.java">SimpCompLL1Gram</A> (the latter is merely the
former with left-recursion removed).  Each concrete grammar exports its
terminals and nonterminals to the rest of the package.

<P> The general interface of a scanner is encapsulated via the abstract
class <A HREF="Scanner.java">Scanner</A> which is setup to deliver <A
HREF="Token.java">Token</A>'s.  This <CODE>Scanner</CODE> class defines
tokens which every scanner should have like <CODE>EOF_TOK</CODE> The program
contains a single instantiation of this <CODE>Scanner</CODE>: the <A
HREF="SimpCompScanner.java">SimpCompScanner</A> class.  This class exports
the token values for all its multi-character tokens (single-character fixed
tokens have as token values the value of the character).

<P> Parsing is done using a separate thread from the user-interface thread.
The required synchronization and interface with the rest of the program are
defined by the abstract <A HREF="StepParser.java">StepParser</A> class.
Each subclass of <CODE>StepParser</CODE> must implement a
<CODE>parse()</CODE> method and a <CODE>update()</CODE> method.  The
<CODE>parse()</CODE> method should perform a parse according to the parse
algorithm specified by the client.  After each parse step, the concrete
<CODE>parse()</CODE> method should call the <CODE>waitToStep()</CODE> method
in it superclass.  The <CODE>waitToStep()</CODE> method in
<CODE>StepParser</CODE> waits until the GUI thread has read the results of
the last step, before calling the <CODE>update()</CODE> method to update the
results.  The concrete <CODE>update()</CODE> method provided by each parse
algorithm implementation should update the parser data structures.  If a
parse-error is detected, a <A HREF="ParseException.java">ParseException</A>
is thrown; to stop a parser which is currently running, a <A
HREF="ParseResetException.java">ParseResetException</A> is thrown.  The
exception-handling approach was chosen to handle these conditions, because
it makes it easy to bale out of a recursive-descent parser.

<P> This <CODE>StepParser</CODE> class is further refined into <A
HREF="RecDescent.java">RecDescent</A>, <A
HREF="LL1Parser.java">LL1Parser</A> and <A HREF="SRParser.java">SRParser</A>
classes: these classes implement the basic parsing algorithms.  The parsers
use a parse stack (<A HREF="ParseStk.java">ParseStk</A>) which has entries
of types derived from <A HREF="ParseStkEntry.java">ParseStkEntry</A>.  At
minimum, each parse-stack entry will contain a parse tree having entries of
type <A HREF="ParseNode.java">ParseNode</A>.

<P> <A HREF="RecDescent.java">RecDescent</A> is an abstract class in that it
is independent of any particular grammar.  <A
HREF="SimpCompRecDescent.java">SimpCompRecDescent</A> contains a concrete
recursive-descent parser derived from <CODE>RecDescent</CODE>.  To allow the
program to display the current line in this parser, it is generated from its
source (<A HREF="SimpCompRecDescent.jpp">.jpp</A> file by using the
C-preprocessor to expand macros which grab the line number (among other
things).

<P> The <A HREF="LL1Parser.java">LL1Parser</A> implements the basic LL(1)
parsing algorithm by interpreting an abstract <A
HREF="LL1Table.java">LL1Table</A>.  The example program contains a concrete
<CODE>LL1Table</CODE> in the class <A
HREF="SimpCompLL1Table.java">SimpCompLL1Table</A>.  The parse-stack contains
<A HREF="LL1ParseStkEntry.java">LL1ParseStkEntry</A>.'s which are derived
from <CODE>ParseStkEntry</CODE>, to additionally contain the current rule
number and grammar symbol.

<P> The <A HREF="SRParser.java">SRParser</A> implements the basic
shift-reduce parsing algorithm by interpreting an abstract <A
HREF="SRTable.java">SRTable</A> with entries of type <A
HREF="SRAct.java">SRAct</A>.  The example program contains a concrete
<CODE>SRTable</CODE> in the class <A
HREF="SimpCompSRTable.java">SimpCompSRTable</A>.  The parse-stack contains
<A HREF="SRParseStkEntry.java">SRParseStkEntry</A>.'s which are derived from
<CODE>ParseStkEntry</CODE>, to additionally contain the state # of the
corresponding <A HREF="SRState.java">SRState</A>.


<H2> GUI Classes </H2>

<P> Most of the widgets used in the GUI are standard <CODE>awt</CODE>
widgets, but three of them are custom-canvases.  These correspond to the
parse trace display, the parse tree/forest display, and the parse
table/program display.  The last two displays also have the capability of
having portions of selected, to highlight certain objects: this is achieved
using the <A HREF="Selectable.java">Selectable</A> interface.

<P> The canvas which all other custom canvases build on is implemented in
the <A HREF="ScrollableCanvas.java">ScrollableCanvas</A> class.
Conceptually, this class contains a <CODE>Canvas</CODE> with two
<CODE>Scrollbars</CODE>.  The implementation uses a <A
HREF="ScrollPanel.java">ScrollPanel</A> derived from <CODE>Panel</CODE>.
When any instance of <CODE>ScrollableCanvas</CODE> is to be inserted into a
container, it is its <CODE>ScrollPanel</CODE> member (obtained using
<CODE>getComponent()</CODE>) which must be inserted instead.  This canvas
also implements crude mouse hints by means of a image its subclasses are
free to provide.

<P> A <A HREF="TextCanvas.java">TextCanvas</A> is derived from
<CODE>ScrollableCanvas</CODE> to contain lines of text.  It implements the
above <CODE>SelectableCanvas</CODE> interface to allow a single line to be
selected.  It uses auxiliary classes <A HREF="TextMark.java">TextMark</A>
and <A HREF="TextLine.java">TextLine</A>.

<P> A <A HREF="FileCanvas.java">FileCanvas</A> is a trivial subclass of
<CODE>TextClass</CODE>, which initializes itself from a
<CODE>FileInputStream</CODE>.  It is used to display the program in the
recursive descent parser.

<P> A <A HREF="Table2Canvas.java">Table2Canvas</A> is derived from
<CODE>ScrollableCanvas</CODE> to contain a <A HREF="Table2.java">Table2</A>.
It implements the above <CODE>SelectableCanvas</CODE> interface to allow
rows/columns to be selected.  Scrolling this canvas keeps the table headings
visible.  It is used for displaying the parse tables for the LL(1) and SR
parsers.


<P> A <A HREF="TraceCanvas.java">TraceCanvas</A> is derived from
<CODE>ScrollableCanvas</CODE> and uses an auxiliary <A
HREF="Trace.java">Trace</A> class to display the parse trace for all three
parsers.  The stack string displayed as part of the trace is obtained by
applying the <CODE>toString()</CODE> method to the <A
HREF="ParseStk.java">ParseStk</A> class: the <CODE>toString()</CODE> method
prints out the stack entries appropriate to the class of
<CODE>ParseStk</CODE>.  The input string displayed as part of the trace is
obtained by using the <CODE>restInput()</CODE> method on a scanner
concatenated to the current lookahead.

<P> Laying out of trees is achieved by the <A
HREF="OffsetTree.java">OffsetTree</A> class which is derived from a <A
HREF="Tree.java">Tree</A> (of all the classes in the program, this is
probably algorithmically the most complex).  (I believe there is a newer
paper which may be relevant.  I haven't yet had a chance to look at it:
S. Moen, "Drawing Dynamic Trees", IEEE Software, July 1990, pp. 21 - 28).
The <A HREF="TreeCanvas.java">TreeCanvas</A> class actually displays a
forest of <CODE>OffsetTree</CODE>'s, where the class <A
HREF="OffsetForest.java">OffsetForest</A> is simply implemented as the
subtrees of a <OffsetTree> with a invisible root.

<H2> Interface Classes </H2>

<P> <A HREF="ParseDisplay.java">ParseDisplay</A> contains within it
references to the widgets used to display the state of the parse.  It is
created by the top-level and passed over to the parser.  When each parse
step is completed, the parser updates the <CODE>ParseDisplay</CODE> with its
latest data structures.  <A HREF="ExtFrame.java">ExtFrame</A> is an
auxiliary class used to capture the external browser context: the parse
display updates an instance of this class to show the current rule/state in
an auxiliary brower frame.

<H2> Top-level Classes </H2>

<P> <A HREF="ParsDemo.java">ParsDemo</A> is the main top-level class.  It
can be invoked either as an applet, as a full-frame applet or from the
command-line.  Depending on its invocation context, it obtains its single
argument (the algorithm to run) from either its applet context or from the
command line.  It creates and lays out all the GUI widgets.  It creates a
scanner and a parser determined by the specified algorithm.  It creates an
enabled <CODE>ExtFrame</CODE> object iff it was created directly by a
browser as an applet.  Finally, it creates a parser thread and starts it.
It interacts with the parser thread by calling the <CODE>doStep()</CODE>
function which corresponds to the <CODE>step</CODE> button in the GUI.  It
implements the <CODE>runnable</CODE> interface to allow starting an
auxiliary thread to auto-step the parser by a delay controlled by a
scrollbar.

<P> <A HREF="AppletFrame.java">AppletFrame</A> provides the context to run
<CODE>ParsDemo</CODE> either from the command-line or as a sub-applet of
another applet.

<P> <A HREF="FullFrame.java">FullFrame</A> is another applet which merely
displays a <CODE>start</CODE> button.  When the button is clicked, it starts
up the <CODE>ParsDemo</CODE> applet in a full-frame.

<H2> Known Bugs and Deficiencies </H2>

<OL>

<LI> When the parser is auto-step'ing (after the <CODE>run</CODE> button has
been clicked), clicking the <CODE>stop</CODE> button does not stop the
parser immediately, but only after an additional step.  This detracts from
the responsiveness of the user-interface.

<LI> If the parser is auto-step'ing (after the <CODE>run</CODE> button has
been clicked), hitting return in the input text-area, restarts the parser in
the auto-step mode.  This is somewhat counter-intuitive.

<LI> The <CODE>TreeCanvas</CODE> draws the entire forest it is displaying,
rather than only the portion which is visible.  This may be problematic on
slower machines.

</OL>

(2) could be explained away as a feature! 

<H2> Weaknesses </H2>

<OL>

<LI> The event-handling code in <A HREF="ParsDemo.java">ParsDemo</A> has
evolved, and has gotten extremely clumsy (witness bugs (1) and (2)).  This
could use a rewrite.

<LI> The algorithm used for <A HREF="OffsetTree.java">OffsetTree</A> class
is complex enough, that bugs could lurk in there.  I don't yet have a good
framework for testing GUI programs, except manually.

<LI> This is my first Java program.  Though the language seemed easy to pick
up, I can't say the same about the libraries.  Since I was learning the
system as I was going along, portions of the code could use a cleanup.

</OL>

<H2> To Do </H2>

<OL>

<LI> A back button to step the parser backwards would be useful.  The
recursive descent parser is the most problematic for implementing this.
Alternatives: 

<OL TYPE=a>

<LI> Keep track of the current # of steps.  Restart the parser from scratch
and step one fewer than the previous # of steps.  This is pretty horrendous
from an efficiency point of view, but just might work for the toy languages
used in a demo and the way hardware is evolving.

<LI> Keep track of incremental information to undo a step.  This is
relatively easy for the table-driven parsers, but difficult for the
recursive descent parser.  To get the recursive descent parser program to
run backwards, the best I can think of is to throw an exception to get out
of the current function invocation, catching the exception just outside the
current invocation.  Then rerun that function forwards again.  However, do
not step into any recursive CALL's, but merely reuse information that was
saved the first time.

<LI> Use incremental state undo information as in (b), but implement
the recursive-descent parser using an interpreter, rather than a java
program.
