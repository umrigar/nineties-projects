<H1>Fully Static Dimensional Analysis with <CODE>C++</CODE></H1>


<P> This package uses <CODE>C++</CODE> templates to ensure the <EM>dimensional
correctness</EM> of programs at compile-time.  Dimensional correctness
ensures that all program statements are </EM>well-dimensioned</EM>,
preventing nonsense like adding <EM>mass</EM> to <EM>time</EM>.

<P> This package was described in my <A HREF="sigplan/sigplan.html">Sigplan
paper</A> (Siplan Notices 29 (9), Sep 1994, pp. 135--139).  A similar idea
appears in the book <EM>Scientific and Engineering <CODE>C++</CODE>: An
Introduction with Advanced Techniques and Examples</EM>, by John J. Barton
and Lee R. Nackman, Addison-Wesley, 1994, ISBN 0-201-53393-6.  The same
authors also described the idea in a article <EM>Dimensional Analysis</EM>,
in <CODE>C++</CODE> Report, Jan 95, pp. 39--43.

<P> After writing the above paper, I found out that the <CODE>C++</CODE>
extensions this approach requires (beyond that described in the Annotated
Reference Manual (ARM), Ellis & Stroustrup, 1990) are now a standard part of
the language and should work with a fully conforming <CODE>C++</CODE>
compiler.

<P> The bulk of the package and all its documentation is the header file <A
HREF="./Dim.h">Dim.h</A> which is automatically generated by <CODE>m4</CODE>
from <A HREF="./Dim.hm4">Dim.hm4</A>.  There are also a few examples: <A
HREF="./slide.cc">slide.cc</A> which simulates a block sliding down a
inclined plane; the same program with <A HREF="./slideBug.cc">dimensional
errors</A>; a program which calculates the period of a <A
HREF="./period.cc">simple pendulum</A>; a program which illustrates the use
of the package for <A HREF="./ratPow.cc">rational powers</A>.

<P> The package seems to really stress existing <CODE>C++</CODE> compilers; at least the
ones I have used.  Primarily for that reason, I would regard the package as
<EM>proof-of-concept</EM>, but it could form the basis of a methodology for
ensuring the dimensional correctness of <CODE>C++</CODE> programs at compile-time.

<P> You can <A HREF="ftp://watson2.cs.binghamton.edu/pub/zdu/dim-1.02.tar.gz">
ftp </A> the entire package, including source and postscript for the Sigplan
paper.
