AUG 97 Version 1.02
No major code changes; merely repackaged for WWW distribution.
Commented out definition of PI in period.cc.
Corrected some incorrect comments in Dim.hm4
Edited README.
Added Makefile, index.html.


JUNE 95 Version 1.01.
Changed the name of the file Dim.h.m4 to Dim.hm4 to facilitate transit
through the MSDos world.

To go from gcc 2.6.0 to 2.6.3, I changed constants in the examples from ints to
doubles, since 2.6.3 enforces the restriction that template functions must
match exactly.  

Changed some const'ness declarations for powers in Dim.hm4.  This resulted
in dim-1.01.

Added this CHANGES file, edited the README.

SEPTEMBER 94 Version 1.0.
To go from gcc 2.5.8 to 2.6.0, I changed some of the const'ness of declarations
in Dim.h.m4 as 2.6.0 seems to do more const'ness checking than 2.5.8.
The resulting dim-1.0 was the first public release.

MARCH 94.
Package completed and ran under gcc 2.5.8.
