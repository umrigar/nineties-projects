The advantages of the proposed method are as follows:
<UL><LI> Full analysis of dimensional correctness <B>before</B> run-time.<LI> No run-time space overhead for dimensional data, unlike the
method proposed in [<A HREF="node9.html#cmelik88">CG88</A>].  Space is used for storing
conversion factors and print-names, but similar amounts of space
would be used by any method which converted between units or
printed them out.<LI> Once compiler technology for processing inline template
functions is sufficiently developed, there should not be any
substantial time or code-space overhead.  This follows from the
statement on pg. 342 of the ARM that the C++ template mechanism
``allows close to optimal run-time performance through macro
expansion of definitions and inlining of function calls.''<LI> The method almost fits into an existing language and is
accepted by an existing compiler.  This is in contrast to methods
like those in [<A HREF="node9.html#gehani77">Geh77</A>] or [<A HREF="node9.html#house83">Hou83</A>] which require
changes to existing languages.<LI> Higher programmer productivity, since programmers need not
spend their time tracking down dimensional errors at run-time.

Some of the disadvantages of the method, along with possible
solutions are:
<P>
<UL><LI> All quantities having a particular dimension use the same
internal unit. Hence the programmer does not have sufficient
control over the precision of dimensional quantities, which may
lead to an accumulation of floating point error.  This may be the
most serious disadvantage of the method.  It may be possible to
extend the method to allow multiple reference units along each
dimension.  In the interim, a possible workaround would be for the
programmer to assign the same quantity to multiple dimensions
having internal units of different precision, and manually program
operations involving these dimensions.<LI> The binary arithmetic operations require that their operands
be dimensioned quantities with <EM>identical</EM> underlying types.
This can be inconvenient when dimensioned quantities contain
multiple underlying types. For example, addition of a dimensioned
<TT>int</TT> to a dimensioned <TT>double</TT> is not supported.<LI> No direct support for derived units.  However, it is always
possible for the programmer to include definitions like:

<PRE>#define Newton	(Kg*Meter/(Sec*Sec))
#define Newton_	(Kg_*Meter_/(Sec_*Sec_))</PRE>

and to provide output functions to handle such derived units.<LI> The set of dimensions required by the program must be known
at compile-time.<LI> It is not possible to represent relationships between units
having different origins (like that between the Celsius and
Fahrenheit temperature scales).  This should not be a problem as
such situations are relatively uncommon.<LI> An increase in compilation time (by over a factor of 3 for
the example in section <A HREF="node4.html#SecExample">4</A>).   However, it is still much
easier for a compiler rather than a human to find errors.<LI> In some C++ environments, a few dimensional errors may not
be detected until link-time when definitions are generated for
template functions.  This may be rather inconvenient.<LI> Errors are not reported in terms of dimensional violations,
but in terms of missing function definitions.  The error messages
often contain instantiated template arguments and even mangled
function names.  It may be hard for a programmer to relate an
error message to a dimensional error.  Tools could be developed
to convert concrete error messages to more abstract
dimensional error messages.<LI> Some C++ environments expect help from the programmer in
determining which template instantiations are required.  The
package provides the programmer with a macro to declare instances
of all the (hidden and visible) template classes used by it, but
the programmer still needs to determine which instances need to be
declared.<LI> The code produced by the one compiler (G++) known to accept
the package is currently of poor quality with no inline expansion
of template functions. Hopefully, this problem should disappear
over time, for the reasons mentioned above.  In the interim, a
program should first be compiled with full dimensional checking.
Once it is free of dimensional errors, it can be recompiled with
dimensional checking turned off (as discussed in the previous
section).  However, this recompilation is rather inconvenient and
some programmers may sometimes choose to omit the first
compilation step.
