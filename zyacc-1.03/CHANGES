8/29/96: zyacc 1.03: bug fixes + changes.

Minor bug fixes: 

Enhancements:
Added support for interactive debugging using a java GUI.

Changed definition of %look declarations to a stronger definition.

Verified correct operation of yylloc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4/03/96: zyacc 1.02: bug fixes + changes.  Inconsistent token types
declaration still not caught.

Bug Fixes:
Fixed incorrect RR conflict resolution.
Fixed initialization problem for table compression.

Unhancements:
Removed support for embedded scanner, since it appeared to be of limited
utility and too featuritis oriented.

Enhancements:
1.  Added automatic declarations of multi-character literal tokens which had
C identifier names.  With the addition of the --term-suffix option, it
is possible to implicitly declare tokens like reserved words which have no
semantics.

2.  Instead of generating one massive html file, the --html (-H) option
now generates several different files.  This should hopefully make the
html output usable without getting the browsers bogged down figuring
out intra-file references.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3/29/96: zyacc 1.01: minor portability and bug fixes.  Inconsistent token
types declaration still not caught.

1.  In a desire to produce identical parser tables on different platforms, 
setup qsort() comparison routines so as to never return 0.  In a couple 
of cases, I had to add an extra field to the elements being compared
which I could use for comparison when the real values were ==.

2.  Went thru header files and verified all global var declarations were
extern.  Needed to add extern for optionsP in options.h and yytext in
scan.h.

3.  While fixing (1), I fixed a couple of minor printout bugs:

a) In lalr.c a d format specifier was missing the % in "TEST SET #d".
b) In lalr.c:printHTMLStateActions(), tho' testOuts was allocated, it was
never being computed! (with no test-sets being printed). 
c) In gram.c:endRule() added a test around assignment to actN of an internal
action rule so as not to change it if the internal action rule corresponded
to a test.

4.  Setup and added this file to the distribution.
