<H2>Running the Applet</H2>

<P>To start the applet in a separate window, please click this

<APPLET CODEBASE="%s" CODE="zdu.zydebug.FullFrame.class"
  WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN="ABSMIDDLE">

button.  Please be patient; depending on the speed of your network
connection, it may take a few minutes to load. 

<P> As the applet is talking to a compiled C parser with unobstrusive
debugging hooks, it is not possible to have the applet <A
NAME="restart"><I>restart</I></A> the parser once it has completed its
parse.  Instead you will have to repeat the procedure you followed to get to
this page.

<P>The applet has four main windows.  Clockwise from the top-left they are
the following:

<DL>

<DT><B>Parse Forest Window</B><DD> Shows the current parse-forest.  The
nodes on top are the nodes currently on the stack.  Terminal nodes are in
red, non-terminal nodes are in green and error nodes are in pink.  The last
active node is highlighted in yellow.  Each node contains text of the form
<VAR>S</VAR><CODE>/</CODE><VAR>Sym</VAR>, where <VAR>S</VAR> is the state at
which that node was created and <VAR>Sym</VAR> is the grammar symbol or
token semantics corresponding to the node.  <B>The nodes in the top row
correspond to nodes currently on the parse stack</B>.

<P> Each non-leaf node in the forest is clickable.  Clicking on such a node
hides all its subtrees; clicking again on that node displays the subtrees
again.  This can be useful as the parse tree typically gets pretty large for
practical parsers.

<DT><B>Trace Window</B><DD> Shows the parse stack in gray (each entry is
in the same format as a parse tree node), the current lookahead in red
and the following action in blue.

<DT><B>Breakpoint Window</B><DD>This allows you to set/clear breakpoints
on all or selected nonterminals and terminals.  Clicking a line in the
window sets a breakpoint on the symbol displayed on that line; clicking
it again clears the breakpoint.  The currently selected breakpoints
are highlighted.

<DT><B>Source Window</B><DD> Shows the parser source file.  During a
reduction, the line corresponding to the reduction is highlighted.

</DL>

<P>The debugger is controlled by the following controls:

<DL>

<DT><B>Shadows Checkbox</B><DD> This checkbox controls whether or not the
parser shows crude shadows while displaying the parse forest.  It is
useful to avoid having shadows cluttering up the display of large forests.

<DT><B>Update Checkbox</B><DD> Selecting this checkbox results in the parser
displaying the current state in the LR(0) machine in a browser frame.  For
this to work, the parser should have been generated using the -H option, and
the environmental variable <CODE>ZYDEBUG_HTMLBASE</CODE> should have been
specified when the parser was started. 

<DT><B>Step Button</B><DD> Steps the parser by a single step.

<DT><B>Next Button</B><DD> Steps the parser to the next shift action.

<DT><B>Continue Button</B><DD> Steps the parser till the next breakpoint.
If no breakpoints are set, then the parser runs to completion.
It is not possible to <A HREF="#restart">restart</A> the parser.

</DL>
