<P>
Zyacc provides facilities to get a debugger compiled into your program.
The resulting program can be debugged in several different ways:
<P>
<OL>

<LI>
You can interact with the program using a command-line interface and
control it using simple single letter debugging commands.  This approach has
the disadvantage that debugger I/O is interspersed with the I/O of your
program.

<LI>
As in (1) above, but separate processes are used to run your program
and the debugger interface.  These processes communicate using a
socket-based interface.  Hence the program being debugged can be on a
computer different from the one on which you are doing the debugging, or it
could be on the same one (the usual case).  When debugging and running your
program on the same computer, you can run your program in one window and
debug it from another window.  This avoids the problem in (1) where
debugger and program I/O are interspersed.

<LI>
As in (2) above, but the interaction uses a GUI java-based application,
rather than a command-line interface.  Most of the facilities of the
command-line interface are available via the GUI.

<LI>
By specifying certain environmental variables when you run your
program, you can get it to generate HTML files which can then be accessed
using any Web browser.  The GUI used in (3) is then run as a java applet by
accessing the generated HTML files using your favorite Web browser.  This
approach has the advantage that the GUI can automatically use your Web
browser to display the current state of the parser in the HTML files
generated using the <CODE>--HTML</CODE> option (see section <A HREF="zyacc_10.html#SEC119">Invoking Zyacc</A>).

</OL>

<A NAME="IDX190"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC105" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC105">Building Debugging Parsers</A></H2>
<P>
To build a parser which can be debugged, it is necessary to define a C
preprocessor symbol when compiling the generated parser and to link your 
program with the Zyacc library.  Optionally, if you would like token
semantics to be printed out, then you need to define an auxiliary function.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC106" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC106">Compiling Debugging Parsers</A></H3>
<P>
To enable compilation of debugging facilities, you must define the C
preprocessor macro <CODE>YY_ZYACC_DEBUG</CODE> to be nonzero when you compile the
parser.  This can be done in any of the following ways:
<P>
<OL>

<LI>
You can define the <CODE>YY_ZYACC_DEBUG</CODE> macro in the C-declarations
section of section 1 of your Zyacc source file.  

<LI>
You can use the <CODE>-t</CODE> or <CODE>--debug</CODE> option when you run Zyacc
(see section <A HREF="zyacc_10.html#SEC119">Invoking Zyacc</A>).  This results in a definition
of <CODE>YY_ZYACC_DEBUG</CODE> automatically being added to the generated parser.

<LI>
You can define the <CODE>YY_ZYACC_DEBUG</CODE> macro on the compiler command
line when you compile the generated parser.  For most compilers, this can
typically be done by specifying the option <CODE>-DYY_ZYACC_DEBUG</CODE>.

</OL>
<P>
The third approach is the recommended approach as it defers the debugging
decision to the latest possible point in the build process.
<P>
For compatibility with other parser generators, the macro <CODE>YYDEBUG</CODE> can
be used instead of <CODE>YY_ZYACC_DEBUG</CODE>.  Zyacc provides
<CODE>YY_ZYACC_DEBUG</CODE> in addition to <CODE>YYDEBUG</CODE> for the following
reason: <CODE>YYDEBUG</CODE> is also used to turn on debugging in lex-based
scanner generators; if a project uses both lex and yacc, and its compilation
is controlled by a Makefile then it can sometimes be inconvenient to turn on
debugging in the parser but not in the scanner, or vice-versa.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC107" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC107">Linking Debugging Parsers</A></H3>
<P>
A debugging parser must be linked with the Zyacc library.  Depending on your
system, you may also need to link it with the networking library ---
typically you need to specify <CODE>-lsocket</CODE> and <CODE>-lnsl</CODE> on the link
command-line.  For most compilers, this is typically done using the <CODE>-L</CODE>
option (for specifying the library path) and the <CODE>-l</CODE> option (for
specifying the library name).  For example, if your project consists of a
parser with object file <CODE>parse.o</CODE> and some helper functions in
<CODE>helpers.o</CODE> and the Zyacc library is installed in the <CODE>lib</CODE>
subdirectory of your home directory, then a typical link command line is:
<P>
<PRE>
	cc parse.o helpers.o -L$HOME/lib -lzyacc -lsocket -lnsl -o my_prj
</PRE>
It is usually necessary that the <CODE>-L</CODE> and <CODE>-l</CODE> options occur
<EM>after</EM> the object files.

<A NAME="IDX192"></A>
<H3><A NAME="SEC108" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC108">Printing Token Semantics</A></H3>
<P>
If you would like to have the debugger print out tokens using their
semantics (rather than the token names), then you need to define a function
to print them out.  If your function is <VAR>semFn</VAR>, then it should have the
prototype
<PRE>
void <VAR>semFn</VAR>(FILE *out, int tokNum, void *yylvalP);
</PRE>
and should print in <CODE>FILE</CODE> out, the semantics associated with the token
whose token number is <CODE>tokNum</CODE> and whose <CODE>yylval</CODE> semantic value
(see section <A HREF="zyacc_5.html#SEC81">Semantic Values of Tokens</A>) is pointed to by <CODE>yylvalP</CODE>.
<P>
You may call this function whatever you like.  You should communicate the
name of the function to Zyacc by defining (in the C declarations section of
the source file) the C preprocessor macro <CODE>YY_SEM_FN</CODE> to the
chosen name.
<P>
If you are only using the textual interface, then this function may print
anything you wish.  However, if you wish to use the GUI, then it is
imperative that the function <STRONG>not print any newlines</STRONG>.  
<P>
If you are using the GUI, then you may also want to define the C macro
<CODE>YY_SEM_MAX</CODE> to specify the maximum number of characters your semantic
function will print.  If you do not define this macro, then a default value
is used.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC109" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC109">Environmental Variables</A></H2>
<P>
Since the program being run is <EM>your</EM> program and Zyacc has no control
over the arguments accepted by your program from the command-line, all
arguments to the debugger are provided via environmental variables.
<P>
If your shell is derived from the C-shell (<CODE>csh</CODE>, <CODE>tcsh</CODE>, etc),
then you can specify an environmental variable using the <CODE>setenv</CODE>
command.  For example, 
<PRE>
	setenv	ZYDEBUG_PORT 1
</PRE>
<P>
If your shell is derived from the Bourne-shell (<CODE>sh</CODE>, <CODE>ksh</CODE>,
<CODE>bash</CODE>, etc), then you can specify an environmental variable using the
<CODE>export</CODE> command.  For example,
<PRE>
	export	ZYDEBUG_PORT=1
</PRE>
<P>
If you prefer to avoid cluttering up your environment with gratuitous
definitions, then the <CODE>sh</CODE>-based derivatives provide a neat
alternative.  You can simply type the variable definitions immediately
before the name of your program, as illustrated by the following example:
<PRE>
	ZYDEBUG_PORT=1 my_prg my_arg1 my_arg2
</PRE>
<P>
The environmental variables used by the Zyacc debugger are listed below.
They are discussed in more detail later.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_APPLET</CODE>
<DD>Specifies the name of a applet to be generated by the debugger.
<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_CODEBASE</CODE>
<DD>Specifies the relative path to the java-based GUI debugger.
<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_HTMLBASE</CODE>
<DD>Specifies the relative path to the HTML files describing your parser.
<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_PORT</CODE>
<DD>Suggests a socket port to be used by the debugger.
<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_SRCBASE</CODE>
<DD>Specifies the relative path to the source file for your parser.

<H2><A NAME="SEC110" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC110">Debugging Parsers Using a Textual Interface</A></H2>
	
Parsers can be debugged using a textual interface with a single
process for both your program and the debugging interface, or by using a
separate process for your program and a separate process for the debugger
interface.  The single process alternative is fine as long as your program
does not generate any terminal I/O.  If your program does generate terminal
I/O, then sorting out your program's I/O from the debugger's I/O could get
messy and multi-process debugging is to be preferred.
<P>
In a networked environment, the multi-process debugger also allows
<EM>remote debugging</EM>, with the program being debugged running on one
computer and the debugging interface running on another computer.  For this
to work, your network environment must support BSD-style sockets, -- this
is usually the case for most modern systems.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC111" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC111">Starting a Single Process Textual Debugger</A></H3>
<P>
To debug your program using a single process textual interface you must
first compile and link your program as outlined in section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC105">Building Debugging Parsers</A>.  Then you should start your program the way your
normally do specifying any command-line arguments required.  You should
not specify any environmental variables.  Your program starts up as
normal and when the parsing function <CODE>yyparse</CODE> is first entered,
the debugger takes control and allows you to interact with it using the
debugger commands (see section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC113">Textual Debugger Commands</A>).  (As mentioned
earlier, if your program does any terminal I/O, then the debugger
interaction will be interspersed with the interaction with your
program).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC112" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC112">Starting a Multiple Process Textual Debugger</A></H3>
<P>
To debug your program using a textual interface with multiple processes
you must first compile and link your program as outlined in
section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC105">Building Debugging Parsers</A>.  To start your program, you should
define the environmental variables described below and then start your
program the way your normally do specifying any command-line arguments
required.  To make the debugger start in multiple-process mode, the
environmental variable (see section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC109">Environmental Variables</A>)
<CODE>ZYDEBUG_PORT</CODE> must be defined when the program is started.  The
value specified for <CODE>ZYDEBUG_PORT</CODE> should be a suggested socket
port number to use: Zyacc merely uses it as a starting point in its
search for a free socket and it is usually best to specify it simply as
1.  Once it finds a free port, it outputs its number to the terminal as
follows:
<PRE>
	zydebug port: 6001
</PRE>
Given the port number, you can start that portion of the debugger which
communicates with your program.  To do this, you should run the
<CODE>zydebug</CODE> program (which should have been installed along with Zyacc)
giving it the above socket number:
<PRE>
	zydebug 6001
</PRE>
If you want to run <CODE>zydebug</CODE> on a computer different from the one where
your program is running then simply type:
<PRE>
	zydebug <VAR>HOST</VAR> <VAR>PORT</VAR>
</PRE>
where <VAR>HOST</VAR> is the network address (hostname or dotted IP address) of
the computer on which your program is running, and <VAR>PORT</VAR> is the port
number output when you started your program.  For example, if I started
the program above on host <CODE>alpha.romeo.com</CODE>, I would use:
<PRE>
	zydebug alpha.romeo.com 6001
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC113" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC113">Textual Debugger Commands</A></H3>
<P>
Irrespective of the manner in which you start the debugger, the commands
it accepts are always the same: a single letter followed by an optional
argument.  These commands allow you to specify breakpoints and
displaypoints.  When the parser encounters a <DFN>breakpoint</DFN> the
debugger suspends execution of the parser and allows you to interact
with it.  When the parser encounters a <CODE>displaypoint</CODE>, the debugger
displays information about the state of the parse.  The concepts of
displaypoints and breakpoints are orthogonal -- i.e. it is possible to
display information at a point in the parse without suspending parser
execution at that point, or vice-versa.
<P>
The commands which are relevant to human users are the following:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>b [<VAR>breakSpec</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>Set or list breakpoint(s) as specified by <VAR>breakSpec</VAR>.  

At a breakpoint, the parser stops and the user can type in commands
(it may or may not display its current state, depending on whether or
not a displaypoint is set too).  If breakSpec is omitted then list all
breakpoints.  breakSpec can have one of the following forms with the
specified meaning:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE><VAR>TERM</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Terminal with name <VAR>TERM</VAR> is about to be shifted.
<DT><CODE><VAR>NON_TERM</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Any rule with LHS nonterminal named <VAR>NON_TERM</VAR> is about to be reduced.
<DT><CODE><VAR>RULE_NUM</VAR></CODE>
<DD>Rule number <VAR>RULE_NUM</VAR> is about to be reduced.
<DT><CODE>%n</CODE>
<DD>Reduce action on any nonterminal.
<DT><CODE>%t</CODE>
<DD>Shift action on any terminal.
<DT><CODE>*</CODE>
<DD>Both shift and reduce actions.
</DL>

<DT><CODE>B [<VAR>breakSpec</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>  Clear breakpoint(s) as specified by <VAR>breakSpec</VAR>.  

  At a breakpoint, the parser stops and the user can type in commands
  (it may or may not display its current state, depending on whether or
  not a displaypoint is set too).  If <VAR>breakSpec</VAR> is omitted then clear all
  breakpoints.  <VAR>breakSpec</VAR> is as specified for the <CODE>b</CODE> command.

<DT><CODE>c [<VAR>temporaryBreakSpec</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>  Continue execution until a breakpoint is entered.

  If <VAR>temporaryBreakSpec</VAR> is specified, then it specifies a temporary break
  point which is automatically cleared whenever the next breakpoint is
  entered. <VAR>temporaryBreakSpec</VAR> can have the same form as <VAR>breakSpec</VAR>
  for the <CODE>b</CODE> command.

<DT><CODE>d [<VAR>displaySpec</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>  Set or list displaypoint(s) as specified by <VAR>displaySpec</VAR>.  

  At a displaypoint, the parser displays its current state (it may or
  may not stop to let the user interact with it, depending on whether or
  not a breakpoint is set too).  If displaySpec is omitted then list 
  all displaypoints.  <VAR>displaySpec</VAR> can have the same form as
  <VAR>breakSpec</VAR> for the <CODE>b</CODE> command.

<DT><CODE>D [<VAR>displaySpec</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>  Clear displaypoint(s) as specified by <VAR>displaySpec</VAR>.  

  At a displaypoint, the parser displays its current state (it may or
  may not stop to let the user interact with it, depending on whether or
  not a breakpoint is set too).  If displaySpec is omitted then clear 
  all displaypoints.  <VAR>displaySpec</VAR> can have the same form as
  <VAR>breakSpec</VAR> for the <CODE>b</CODE> command.

<DT><CODE>h [<VAR>cmd</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>  Print help on single-letter command <VAR>cmd</VAR>.  If <VAR>cmd</VAR> is omitted, 
  give help on all commands.

<DT><CODE>l [<VAR>listSpec</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>  List terminals, non-terminals or rules as specified by <VAR>listSpec</VAR>.  

  If <VAR>listSpec</VAR> is omitted, then all rules are listed.  Otherwise
  <VAR>listSpec</VAR> can be one of the following:

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>%n</CODE>
<DD>List all non-terminal symbols.
<DT><CODE>%t</CODE>
<DD>List all terminal symbols.
<DT><CODE><VAR>RULE_NUM</VAR></CODE>
<DD>List rule with number <VAR>RULE_NUM</VAR>.
</DL>

<DT><CODE>m [<VAR>depth</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>Set maximum <VAR>depth</VAR> printed for the stack.  

If depth is 0 or omitted, then entire stack is printed.

<DT><CODE>n</CODE>

Equivalent to <CODE>c %t</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>p</CODE>
<DD>  Print current parser state.

<DT><CODE>q</CODE>
<DD>  Quit debugger and run parser without debugging.
<DT><CODE>s</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>&#60;blank line&#62;</CODE>

<P>
It is also possible to use a java-based GUI to debug parsers generated by
Zyacc.  This can be done in two ways:
<P>
<OL>

<LI>
The GUI can be used as a standalone java application.  To do this, you
should have a java runtime system installed on your computer.

<LI>
The GUI can be used as an applet from within a web browser which 
supports java.

</OL>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
<H3><A NAME="SEC115" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC115">Starting a GUI Debugger as a Java Application</A></H3>
<P>
To debug your program using a GUI java application you must first
compile and link your program as outlined in section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC105">Building Debugging Parsers</A>.  To use the GUI as a standalone application, you should first
start your program the way your normally do, specifying any command-line
arguments required.  The following environmental variables
(see section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC109">Environmental Variables</A>) are used by your program to control
the setup of the debugger.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_PORT</CODE>
<DD>This is required.  As discussed earlier (see section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC112">Starting a Multiple Process Textual Debugger</A>), it's value is best specified simply as
<CODE>1</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_SRCBASE</CODE>
<DD>This should be the relative path to the parser source file (the
<SAMP>`.y'</SAMP> file) from the directory which is current when the parsing
function <CODE>yyparse</CODE> is first entered.  (The directory in which
<CODE>yyparse</CODE> is entered is usually the same
directory in which your program executable resides, assuming that your
program has not performed any <CODE>chdir()</CODE> calls and that you started
the program in the directory in which it resides).  If it not specified,
it is assumed that your parser source file lives in the directory the
parsing function was in when it was first entered.


</DL>
<P>
When your program starts it will output the port number of the socket it
has connected to; for example:
<PRE>
	zydebug port: 6001
</PRE>
This port number will be used to connect the GUI to your executing
program.
<P>
To start the GUI, you must run the java runtime system on your machine,
telling it where to find the java classfiles referenced by
<CODE>zdu.zydebug.ZYDebug</CODE> which form the GUI and providing it with
arguments telling it how to connect to your executing program.  The
exact procedures may be different on your machine, but as of this
writing, the most common setup is as follows:
<P>
Java is started by simply using the command <CODE>java</CODE>.  For the <CODE>java</CODE>
command to work it must be in your <CODE>PATH</CODE> (see section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC109">Environmental Variables</A>) or you should specify the full path name.  For java to find
the java classfiles for the debugger, those files must be in your
<CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> (see section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC109">Environmental Variables</A>).  Finally, you must
specify the port number output by your program, (optionally preceeded by
the hostname or dotted IP address of the computer on which your program
is running, if it is different from the one on which you are running the
GUI).
<P>
The following example shows the starting a debugger GUI under a
<CODE>csh</CODE> or derivatives.

</PRE>
where <CODE>pear</CODE> is the name of the machine on which the program is

<H3><A NAME="SEC116" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC116">Starting a GUI Debugger as a Java Applet</A></H3>
<P>
A java applet can only be run by being embedded within an HTML file
which provides the environment in which the applet lives.  Among other
things, the HTML file provides the arguments to the applet.
<P>
The debugging applet talks to the program being debugged using a socket
referred to by a port number.  Since this port number can vary for
different executions of the program being debugged, it has to be
provided as an argument to the applet.  As an applet gets its argument
from its associated HTML file, and this particular port number argument
can be different for different executions of the program being debugged,
the HTML file associated with the debugging applet has to be generated
dynamically.
<P>
The HTML file is generated by your enhanced program when it is started
(actually a second HTML file is generated as well).  Using environmental
variables (see section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC109">Environmental Variables</A>) you can specify the names of
the HTML files, as well as paths to various other resources required by
the applet.
<P>
To debug your program using a GUI java applet you must first compile and
link your program as outlined in section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC105">Building Debugging Parsers</A>.  You
should then start your program the way your normally do, specifying any

(see section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC109">Environmental Variables</A>) are used by your program to control
the setup of the debugger.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_APPLET</CODE>
<DD>This is required.  It specifies the root name used for the generated
HTML documents which are used to access the debugging applet.

<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_CODEBASE</CODE>
<DD>This should provide the path to the debugger's java classfiles relative
to the directory where the generated HTML documents live (relative to the
<CODE>DOCBASE</CODE> directory in java terminology).  If not specified, then it is
assumed that the java classfiles reside in the same directory as the
generated HTML documents.

<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_HTMLBASE</CODE>
<DD>This should provide the path to the parser's HTML description files
generated using the <CODE>--HTML</CODE> option see section <A HREF="zyacc_10.html#SEC119">Invoking Zyacc</A>), relative to the directory where the generated HTML documents live
(relative to the <CODE>DOCBASE</CODE> directory in java terminology).  If not
specified, then it is assumed that the HTML description files reside in
the same directory as the generated HTML documents.

<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_PORT</CODE>
<DD>This is not required.  As discussed earlier See section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC112">Starting a Multiple Process Textual Debugger</A>, it's value is best specified simply as
<CODE>1</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>ZYDEBUG_SRCBASE</CODE>
<DD>This is exactly as for the standalone GUI application.  It should be the
relative path to the parser source file (the <SAMP>`.y'</SAMP> file) from the
directory which is current when the parsing function <CODE>yyparse</CODE> is
first entered.  (The directory in which <CODE>yyparse</CODE> is entered is
usually the same directory in which your program executable resides,
assuming that your program has not performed any <CODE>chdir()</CODE> calls
and that you started the program in the directory in which it resides).
If it not specified, it is assumed that your parser source file lives in
the directory the parsing function was in when it was first entered.


</DL>
<P>
Usually, the parser source file and the HTML description files are in
the same directory as the program executable and all you need to specify
are <CODE>ZYDEBUG_APPLET</CODE> and <CODE>ZYDEBUG_CODEBASE</CODE>.
<P>
Consider the following more complicated situation:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>
You would like to put the generated HTML files in <CODE>$HOME/tmp</CODE> with
the name <CODE>XXX</CODE>.

<LI>
The java classfiles reside in <CODE>/usr/local/share/classes</CODE>.

<LI>
The HTML files describing the parser and the source file reside in the parent
directory of the directory in which you start the program.

<LI>
Your enhanced executable program is called <CODE>foo</CODE>
and takes a single argument <CODE>bar</CODE>.

</UL>
<P>
Under <CODE>csh</CODE> and derivatives, you can use the following sequence of
commands: 
<P>
<PRE>
setenv ZYDEBUG_APPLET $HOME/tmp/XXX
setenv CODEBASE /usr/local/share/classes
setenv HTMLBASE `pwd`/..
setenv SRCBASE `pwd`/..
./foo bar
</PRE>
<P>
Under <CODE>sh</CODE> and derivatives, the following command suffices:
<P>
<PRE>
ZYDEBUG_APPLET=$HOME/tmp/XXX CODEBASE=/usr/local/share/classes \
  HTMLBASE=`pwd`/.. SRCBASE=`pwd`/.. \
  ./foo bar
</PRE>
<P>
Having generated the HTML files, you can now use a browser to start the
debugger's GUI and debug your parser.  There are two methods of doing
this available in most browsers: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>View the generated HTML file using the local file access option
provided by most browsers.  This will work only if you are using the
browser on the same machine as the one on which your program is executing.

<LI>View the generated HTML file as a regular remote URL.  For this to
work, all the files required by the applet (the java classfiles, the
parser source file, and the HTML description files) must be accessible
by the HTTP daemon on the remote machine.  This usually requires that
they be within a public html area.

<H3><A NAME="SEC117" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC117">Using the Debugger GUI</A></H3>
<P>
As the applet is talking to your compiled program which has not been
modified in any way, it is not possible to have the applet restart your
program once it has completed its parse.  Instead you will have to
restart the parser and the debugger's GUI applet.
<P>
The applet has four main windows.  Clockwise from the top-left they are
the following:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>Parse Forest Window</EM>
<DD>
Shows the current parse-forest.  The nodes on top are the nodes
currently on the stack.  Terminal nodes are in red, non-terminal nodes
are in green and error nodes are in pink.  The last active node is
highlighted in yellow.  Each node contains text of the form
<VAR>S</VAR><CODE>/</CODE><VAR>Sym</VAR>, where <VAR>S</VAR> is the state at which that node
was created and <VAR>Sym</VAR> is the grammar symbol or token semantics
corresponding to the node.  <EM>The nodes in the top row correspond to
nodes currently on the parse stack</EM>.

Each non-leaf node in the forest is clickable.  Clicking on such a node
hides all its subtrees; clicking again on that node displays the subtrees
again.  This can be useful as the parse tree typically gets pretty large for
practical parsers.

<DT><EM>Trace Window</EM>
<DD>
Shows the parse stack in gray (each entry is
in the same format as a parse tree node), the current lookahead in red
and the following action in blue.

<DT><EM>Breakpoint Window</EM>
<DD>This allows you to set/clear breakpoints
on all or selected nonterminals and terminals.  Clicking a line in the
window sets a breakpoint on the symbol displayed on that line; clicking
it again clears the breakpoint.  The currently selected breakpoints
are highlighted.

<DT><EM>Source Window</EM>
<DD> Shows the parser source file.  During a
reduction, the line corresponding to the reduction is highlighted.

</DL>
<P>
The debugger is controlled by the following controls:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>Shadows Checkbox</EM>
<DD>This checkbox controls whether or not the
parser shows crude shadows while displaying the parse forest.  It is
useful to avoid having shadows cluttering up the display of large forests.

<DT><EM>Update Checkbox</EM>
<DD>Selecting this checkbox results in the parser displaying the current
state in the LR(0) machine in a browser frame.  For this to work, the
parser should have been generated using the <CODE>--HTML</CODE> option
(see section <A HREF="zyacc_10.html#SEC119">Invoking Zyacc</A>), and the environmental variable
<CODE>ZYDEBUG_HTMLBASE</CODE> should have been specified when the parser was
started.

<DT><EM>Step Button</EM>
<DD>Steps the parser by a single step.

<DT><EM>Next Button</EM>
<DD>Steps the parser to the next shift action.

<DT><EM>Continue Button</EM>
<DD>Steps the parser till the next breakpoint.
If no breakpoints are set, then the parser runs to completion.
As mentioned above, it is not possible to restart the parser.

<P>
The popular adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" may be true in
the real world, but with the primitive visualization techniques used by
the GUI debugger, it may not hold for the GUI debugger.  For practical
parsers, the parse forest displayed by the debugger rapidly becomes
unmanageable, even after hiding many large subtrees.  If the large
amount of screen real estate taken up by the parse forest was occupied
instead by words more information might be conveyed.
<P>
It is probably best to use the GUI debugger only under the following
conditions: 
<P>
<UL>

<LI>
Only a limited amount of text is being parsed -- this prevents
inordinate growth of the displayed parse forest.

<LI>
To explain and understand the operation of parsers in general and
LALR(1) parsers in particular.

<LI>
You are a novice and don't feel like climbing the learning curve hillock
represented by the textual commands.

</UL>
<P>
Another problem with GUI debugging is that it can be quite slow as the
java GUI has to build up the parse forest, trace output, etc.  I have
not had a chance to analyze its performance, but I would not be
surprised if it is spending a fair amount of time merely collecting
garbage.
<P>
For debugging most practical parsers, I would recommend the textual
interface.
