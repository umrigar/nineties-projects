This directory contains the documentation for zlex.  The main documentation
source is zlex.texi.  From this single source three different formats are
derived:

zlex.info:	Suitable for viewing in emacs or any standalone info-viewer.
zlex.html:	Can be viewed using any WWW browser like Mosaic or Netscape.
zlex.ps:	Print on your favorite postscript printer.

The zlex.html was derived automatically using the texi2html script written 
by Lionel Cons (Lionel.Cons@cern.ch) from CERN.
