<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC4">The Concepts of Zyacc</A></H1>
<P>
This chapter introduces many of the basic concepts without which the
details of Zyacc will not make sense.  If you do not already know how to
use Zyacc, we suggest you start by reading this chapter carefully.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC5">Languages and Context-Free Grammars</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<P>
In order for Zyacc to parse a language, it must be described by a
<DFN>context-free grammar</DFN>.  This means that you specify one or more
<DFN>syntactic groupings</DFN> and give rules for constructing them from their
parts.  For example, in the C language, one kind of grouping is called an
`expression'.  One rule for making an expression might be, "An expression
can be made of a minus sign and another expression".  Another would be,
"An expression can be an integer".  As you can see, rules are often
recursive, but there must be at least one rule which leads out of the
recursion.
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
<P>
The most common formal system for presenting such rules for humans to read
is <DFN>Backus-Naur Form</DFN> or "BNF", which was developed in order to
specify the language Algol 60.  Any grammar expressed in BNF is a
context-free grammar.  The input to Zyacc is essentially machine-readable
BNF.
<P>
Not all context-free languages can be handled by Zyacc, only those
that are LALR(1).  In brief, this means that it must be possible to
tell how to parse any portion of an input string with just a single
token of look-ahead.  Strictly speaking, that is a description of an
LR(1) grammar, and LALR(1) involves additional restrictions that are
hard to explain simply; but it is rare in actual practice to find an
LR(1) grammar that fails to be LALR(1).  See section <A HREF="zyacc_6.html#SEC97">Mysterious Reduce/Reduce Conflicts</A>, for more information on this.
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<P>
In the formal grammatical rules for a language, each kind of syntactic unit
or grouping is named by a <DFN>symbol</DFN>.  Those which are built by grouping
smaller constructs according to grammatical rules are called
<DFN>nonterminal symbols</DFN>; those which can't be subdivided are called
<DFN>terminal symbols</DFN> or <DFN>token types</DFN>.  We call a piece of input
corresponding to a single terminal symbol a <DFN>token</DFN>, and a piece
corresponding to a single nonterminal symbol a <DFN>grouping</DFN>.<P>
We can use the C language as an example of what symbols, terminal and
nonterminal, mean.  The tokens of C are identifiers, constants (numeric and
string), and the various keywords, arithmetic operators and punctuation
marks.  So the terminal symbols of a grammar for C include `identifier',
`number', `string', plus one symbol for each keyword, operator or
punctuation mark: `if', `return', `const', `static', `int', `char',
`plus-sign', `open-brace', `close-brace', `comma' and many more.  (These
tokens can be subdivided into characters, but that is a matter of
lexicography, not grammar.)
<P>
Here is a simple C function subdivided into tokens:
<P>
<PRE>
int             /* keyword `int' */
square (x)      /* identifier, open-paren, */
                /* identifier, close-paren */
     int x;     /* keyword `int', identifier, semicolon */
{               /* open-brace */
  return x * x; /* keyword `return', identifier, */
                /* asterisk, identifier, semicolon */
}               /* close-brace */
</PRE>
<P>
The syntactic groupings of C include the expression, the statement, the
declaration, and the function definition.  These are represented in the
grammar of C by nonterminal symbols `expression', `statement',
`declaration' and `function definition'.  The full grammar uses dozens of
additional language constructs, each with its own nonterminal symbol, in
order to express the meanings of these four.  The example above is a
function definition; it contains one declaration, and one statement.  In
the statement, each <SAMP>`x'</SAMP> is an expression and so is <SAMP>`x * x'</SAMP>.
<P>
Each nonterminal symbol must have grammatical rules showing how it is made
out of simpler constructs.  For example, one kind of C statement is the
<CODE>return</CODE> statement; this would be described with a grammar rule which
reads informally as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A `statement' can be made of a `return' keyword, an `expression' and a
`semicolon'.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There would be many other rules for `statement', one for each kind of
statement in C.
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<P>
One nonterminal symbol must be distinguished as the special one which
defines a complete utterance in the language.  It is called the <DFN>start
symbol</DFN>.  In a compiler, this means a complete input program.  In the C
language, the nonterminal symbol `sequence of definitions and declarations'
plays this role.
<P>
For example, <SAMP>`1 + 2'</SAMP> is a valid C expression--a valid part of a C
program--but it is not valid as an <EM>entire</EM> C program.  In the
context-free grammar of C, this follows from the fact that `expression' is
not the start symbol.
<P>
The Zyacc parser reads a sequence of tokens as its input, and groups the
tokens using the grammar rules.  If the input is valid, the end result is
that the entire token sequence reduces to a single grouping whose symbol is
the grammar's start symbol.  If we use a grammar for C, the entire input
must be a `sequence of definitions and declarations'.  If not, the parser
reports a syntax error.

<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC6">From Formal Rules to Zyacc Input</A></H2>
<P>
A formal grammar is a mathematical construct.  To define the language
for Zyacc, you must write a file expressing the grammar in Zyacc syntax:
a <DFN>Zyacc grammar</DFN> file.  See section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC37">Zyacc Grammar Files</A>.
<P>
A nonterminal symbol in the formal grammar is represented in Zyacc input
as an identifier, like an identifier in C.  By convention, it should be
in lower case, such as <CODE>expr</CODE>, <CODE>stmt</CODE> or <CODE>declaration</CODE>.
<P>
The Zyacc representation for a terminal symbol is also called a <DFN>token
type</DFN>.  Token types as well can be represented as C-like identifiers.  By
convention, these identifiers should be upper case to distinguish them from
nonterminals: for example, <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, <CODE>IDENTIFIER</CODE>, <CODE>IF</CODE> or
<CODE>RETURN</CODE>.  A terminal symbol that stands for a particular keyword in
the language should be named after that keyword converted to upper case.
The terminal symbol <CODE>error</CODE> is reserved for error recovery.
See section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC43">Symbols, Terminal and Nonterminal</A>.<P>
A terminal symbol can also be represented as a character literal, just like
a C character constant.  You should do this whenever a token is just a
single character (parenthesis, plus-sign, etc.): use that same character in
a literal as the terminal symbol for that token.  Zyacc also permits
literal token names consisting of multiple characters -- in that case,
it is necessary to define an alias used for referring to that token
external to the parser.
<P>
Given this notation, it is easy to express grammar rules in Zyacc syntax.
For example, here is the Zyacc rule for a C <CODE>return</CODE> statement.  The
semicolon in quotes is a literal character token, representing part of the C
syntax for the statement; the naked semicolon, and the colon, are Zyacc
punctuation used in every rule.
<P>
<PRE>
stmt
  : RETURN expr ';'

</PRE>
<P>
See section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC44">Syntax of Grammar Rules</A>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC7">Semantic Values</A></H2>
<P>
A formal grammar selects tokens only by their classifications: for example,
if a rule mentions the terminal symbol `integer constant', it means that
<EM>any</EM> integer constant is grammatically valid in that position.  The
precise value of the constant is irrelevant to how to parse the input: if
<SAMP>`x+4'</SAMP> is grammatical then <SAMP>`x+1'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`x+3989'</SAMP> is equally
grammatical.<P>
But the precise value is very important for what the input means once it is
parsed.  A compiler is useless if it fails to distinguish between 4, 1 and
3989 as constants in the program!  Therefore, each token in a Zyacc grammar
has both a token type and a <DFN>semantic value</DFN>.  See section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC46">Defining Language Semantics</A>,
for details.
<P>
The token type is a terminal symbol defined in the grammar, such as
<CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, <CODE>IDENTIFIER</CODE> or <CODE>','</CODE>.  It tells everything
you need to know to decide where the token may validly appear and how to
group it with other tokens.  The grammar rules know nothing about tokens
except their types.<P>
The semantic value has all the rest of the information about the
meaning of the token, such as the value of an integer, or the name of an
identifier.  (A token such as <CODE>','</CODE> which is just punctuation doesn't
need to have any semantic value.)
<P>
For example, an input token might be classified as token type
<CODE>INTEGER</CODE> and have the semantic value 4.  Another input token might
have the same token type <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> but value 3989.  When a grammar
rule says that <CODE>INTEGER</CODE> is allowed, either of these tokens is
acceptable because each is an <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>.  When the parser accepts the
token, it keeps track of the token's semantic value.
<P>
Each grouping can also have a semantic value as well as its nonterminal
symbol.  For example, in a calculator, an expression typically has a
semantic value that is a number.  In a compiler for a programming
language, an expression typically has a semantic value that is a tree
structure describing the meaning of the expression.
<P>

<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC8">Semantic Actions</A></H2>
<P>
In order to be useful, a program must do more than parse input; it must
also produce some output based on the input.  In a Zyacc grammar, a grammar
rule can have an <DFN>action</DFN> made up of C statements.  Each time the
parser recognizes a match for that rule, the action is executed.
See section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC49">Actions</A>.
        
Most of the time, the purpose of an action is to compute the semantic value
of the whole construct from the semantic values of its parts.  For example,
suppose we have a rule which says an expression can be the sum of two
expressions.  When the parser recognizes such a sum, each of the
subexpressions has a semantic value which describes how it was built up.
The action for this rule should create a similar sort of value for the
newly recognized larger expression.
<P>
For example, here is a rule that says an expression can be the sum of
two subexpressions:
<P>
<PRE>
expr
  : expr '+' expr   { $$ = $1 + $3; }
  ;
</PRE>
<P>
The action says how to produce the semantic value of the sum expression
from the values of the two subexpressions.

<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC9">Zyacc Output: the Parser File</A></H2>
<P>
When you run Zyacc, you give it a Zyacc grammar file as input.  The output
is a C source file that parses the language described by the grammar.
This file is called a <DFN>Zyacc parser</DFN>.  Keep in mind that the Zyacc
utility and the Zyacc parser are two distinct programs: the Zyacc utility
is a program whose output is the Zyacc parser that becomes part of your
program.
<P>
The job of the Zyacc parser is to group tokens into groupings according to
the grammar rules--for example, to build identifiers and operators into
expressions.  As it does this, it runs the actions for the grammar rules it
uses.
<P>
The tokens come from a function called the <DFN>lexical analyzer</DFN> that you
must supply in some fashion (such as by writing it in C).  The Zyacc parser
calls the lexical analyzer each time it wants a new token.  It doesn't know
what is "inside" the tokens (though their semantic values may reflect
this).  Typically the lexical analyzer makes the tokens by parsing
characters of text, but Zyacc does not depend on this.  See section <A HREF="zyacc_5.html#SEC79">The Lexical Analyzer Function <CODE>yylex</CODE></A>.
<P>
The Zyacc parser file is C code which defines a function named
<CODE>yyparse</CODE> which implements that grammar.  This function does not make
a complete C program: you must supply some additional functions.  One is
the lexical analyzer.  Another is an error-reporting function which the
parser calls to report an error.  In addition, a complete C program must
start with a function called <CODE>main</CODE>; you have to provide this, and
arrange for it to call <CODE>yyparse</CODE> or the parser will never run.
See section <A HREF="zyacc_5.html#SEC77">Parser C-Language Interface</A>.
<P>
Aside from the token type names and the symbols in the actions you
write, all variable and function names used in the Zyacc parser file
begin with <SAMP>`yy'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`YY'</SAMP>.  This includes interface functions
such as the lexical analyzer function <CODE>yylex</CODE>, the error reporting
function <CODE>yyerror</CODE> and the parser function <CODE>yyparse</CODE> itself.
This also includes numerous identifiers used for internal purposes.
Therefore, you should avoid using C identifiers starting with <SAMP>`yy'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`YY'</SAMP> in the Zyacc grammar file except for the ones defined in
this manual.

<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC10">Stages in Using Zyacc</A></H2>
<P>
The actual language-design process using Zyacc, from grammar specification
to a working compiler or interpreter, has these parts:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Formally specify the grammar in a form recognized by Zyacc
(see section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC37">Zyacc Grammar Files</A>).  For each grammatical rule in the language,
describe the action that is to be taken when an instance of that rule
is recognized.  The action is described by a sequence of C statements.

<LI>
Write a lexical analyzer to process input and pass tokens to the
parser.  The lexical analyzer may be written by hand in C
(see section <A HREF="zyacc_5.html#SEC79">The Lexical Analyzer Function <CODE>yylex</CODE></A>).  It could also be produced using Lex, but the use
of Lex is not discussed in this manual.

<LI>
Write a controlling function that calls the Zyacc-produced parser.

<LI>
Write error-reporting routines.
</OL>
<P>
To turn this source code as written into a runnable program, you
must follow these steps:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Run Zyacc on the grammar to produce the parser.

<LI>
Compile the code output by Zyacc, as well as any other source files.

<LI>
Link the object files to produce the finished product.
</OL>

<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC11">The Overall Layout of a Zyacc Grammar</A></H2>
<P>
The input file for the Zyacc utility is a <DFN>Zyacc grammar file</DFN>.  The
general form of a Zyacc grammar file is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
%{
<VAR>C declarations</VAR>
%}

<VAR>Zyacc declarations</VAR>

%%
<VAR>Grammar rules</VAR>
%%
<VAR>Additional C code</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
The <SAMP>`%%'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`%{'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`%}'</SAMP> are punctuation that appears
in every Zyacc grammar file to separate the sections.
<P>
The C declarations may define types and variables used in the actions.
You can also use preprocessor commands to define macros used there, and use
<CODE>#include</CODE> to include header files that do any of these things.
<P>
The Zyacc declarations declare the names of the terminal and nonterminal
symbols, and may also describe operator precedence and the data types of
semantic values of various symbols.
<P>
The grammar rules define how to construct each nonterminal symbol from its
parts.
<P>
The additional C code can contain any C code you want to use.  Often the
definition of the lexical analyzer <CODE>yylex</CODE> goes here, plus subroutines
called by the actions in the grammar rules.  In a simple program, all the
rest of the program can go here.
