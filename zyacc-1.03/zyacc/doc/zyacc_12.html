<P>
Internal versions of the Zyacc parser generator have been used by me since
1995.  It has been used by about 45 students in compiler construction
courses.  There have been some major rewrites.

<H2><A NAME="SEC126" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC126">Suspicions</A></H2>
Normally, when a program has been completed, one has a reasonable idea where
bugs might still lurk.  On that basis, for what they are worth, I present my
current suspicions:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>The Parser Generator
<DD>I feel fairly good about the code which actually generates parsers.  Under
normal error-free operation, the weakest areas may be the code which does
the LALR computation and the graph coloring for packing inherited
attributes (since most states of most parsers can get by with SLR lookahead
and most programs I've written didn't make very heavy use of inherited
attributes, the code has just not been exercised enough).  

The bugs most likely to manifest themselves will probably be
<CODE>assert</CODE>ion failures <STRONG>caused by an erroneous Zyacc source file</STRONG>.
In that case, you can simply correct the error in the Zyacc source file and
continue on with reasonable confidence (after submitting a bug report, of
course).

<DT>The Runtime System
<DD>The runtime system has been fairly stable for a while.  The weakest area may
be error processing.

<P>
First you will need to be sure that you have found a Zyacc bug:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>
If when running Zyacc, it bombs with a assertion failure or a core dump, you
can be sure that you have uncovered a bug.  However, even though you have
uncovered a Zyacc bug, the problem may have been caused by an error in your
source file; you can fix the error and continue working.

<LI>
If when running a Zyacc generated parser, it bombs or does not do what you
intended it to do, it is much more difficult to be sure whether the problem
is within the Zyacc runtime system or in your code.  If it bombs within the
main parser function, make sure that it is not within your actions.

</UL>
<P>
If you are sure that you have uncovered a bug, try to distil it down to a
test program which is as short as possible while still exhibiting the bug.
Record a log which exhibits the bug.  Make sure that you mention the version
of Zyacc you are using in your bug report.
