<P>
The following lists Bison features which are not available or work
differently in Zyacc:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>
In Bison multi-character literals are enclosed within double-quotes, whereas
Zyacc uses single-quotes for both single and multi-character literals.  The
Bison approach is more consistent with C; the Zyacc approach avoids making
another character special (the Zyacc approach predates the public release of
this feature in Bison).

<LI>
Zyacc does not have any public interface to retrieve a token number given
its name, similar to Bison's <CODE>yytname</CODE> table.

<LI>
Zyacc does not support Bison's <CODE>YYBACKUP()</CODE> macro.

<LI>
Bison allows the use of <CODE>%type</CODE> declarations to declare the types of
terminal symbols, even though the manual seems to imply that <CODE>%type</CODE>
can be used only for declaring the types of nonterminals.  This feature
appears useful.

<LI>
Zyacc's debugging facilities are quite different from Bison's trace
facility.
