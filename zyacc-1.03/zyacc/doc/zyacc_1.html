<P>
<DFN>Zyacc</DFN> is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a
grammar description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C
program to parse that grammar.  Once you are proficient with Zyacc,
you may use it to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those
used in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.
<P>
Zyacc is largely upward compatible with Yacc and Bison: all properly-written
Yacc and Bison grammars ought to work with Zyacc with minimal change.
Anyone familiar with Yacc or Bison should be able to use Zyacc with little
trouble.  This manual uses the spellings Zyacc, Bison and Yacc to refer to
the specific programs, while using the spelling yacc to refer to any one of
the above programs.  You need to be fluent in C programming in order to use
Zyacc or to understand this manual.
<P>
We begin with tutorial chapters that explain the basic concepts of using
Zyacc and show six explained examples, each building on the last.  If you
don't know yacc or Zyacc, start by reading these chapters.  Reference
chapters follow which describe specific aspects of Zyacc in detail.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC2">Acknowledgements</A></H2>
The bulk of this manual is derived from the well-written Bison
manual (see section `Bison Manual' in <CITE>Bison: The YACC-compatible Parser Generator</CITE>).  The changes made by the present author include
reformatting the examples and adding sections specific to Zyacc.
<P>
Many of the algorithms used within Zyacc is based on work by others.  See
the <CODE>zyacc/refs.bib</CODE> file included with the distribution for some of
the references.

<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="zyacc_toc.html#SEC3">Zyacc Enhancements</A></H2>
<P>
Zyacc provides the following enhancements:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>
Supports inherited attributes which can be uniquely evaluated in a
left-to-right parse (see section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC55">Inherited Attributes</A>).

<LI>
Supports semantic tests which allow the outcome of runtime semantic
tests to affect parsing decisions (see section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC59">Semantic Tests</A>).

<LI>
Permits remote interactive debugging of generated parsers either by using a
textual interface or by using a java-based GUI (see section <A HREF="zyacc_9.html#SEC104">Debugging Your Parser</A>).  The
debugger allows the setting of breakpoints on any grammar symbol and
selective display of the current parser state.

<LI>
Allows named attribute variables which make maintaining grammars easier
(see section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC52">Named Attributes</A>).

<LI>
Can generate its parser description files in HTML which can then be
viewed using any Web browser (see section <A HREF="zyacc_10.html#SEC122">Zyacc Options</A>).

<LI>
Provides a <CODE>%look</CODE> directive to check (at parser construction time)
whether a reduction requires lookahead (see section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC74">Specifying the Lookahead</A>).

<LI>
Allows multiple start nonterminals and allows a call to the parsing function
to be made for a particular start nonterminal (see section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC70">The Start-Symbol</A>). 

<LI>
It is possible to avoid having types which are only used in describing
nonterminal semantics written into the generated <SAMP>`.h'</SAMP> file
(see section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC47">Data Types of Semantic Values</A>).

<LI>
Allows multiple-character quoted literal tokens (see section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC66">Multi-Character Literal Tokens</A>).

<LI>
Allows command-line options to be specified from within the parser file
(see section <A HREF="zyacc_4.html#SEC73">Option Declaration</A>).
