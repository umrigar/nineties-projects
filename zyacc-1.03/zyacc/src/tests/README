This directory contains regression tests for zyacc.

Best to run with GNU-make.  Ultrix make has problems.  If your make has
problems, go to the Makefile and search for the line which contains the
string @@@, and try commenting out the following dependency.

Requires a cc which understands function prototypes.

attrfrnt test puts make output into a file which is compared with log (a sed
filter tries to get rid of this, but is not always successful).  Since
different makes produce different kinds of output, this can lead to trivial
errors.
