This directory contains a small program which converts fragments of C source
files to TeXInfo.  It is not made by default, since it is only needed to
generate the documentation.  It contains a configured Makefile --- to
make it, simply type `make' in this directory.

If you modify the source file c2tex.l, you will need zlex to regenerate the
c2tex.c which is distributed.
